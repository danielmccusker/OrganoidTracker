# The scripts
[‚Üê Back to main page](./INDEX.md)

The following scripts are available:

* `ai_track.py` - starts a graphical program, which is used to visualize all data.
* `ai_track_compare_positions.py` - compare two sets of position detection data
* `ai_track_compare_links.py` - compare two sets of linking data.
* `ai_track_create_links.py` - uses a cell positions file to link cells from different time points together.
* `ai_track_detect_gaussian_shapes.py` - uses the raw images and provided cell positions to 
* `ai_track_extract_mother_scores.py` - creates a CSV file, showing how the mother scores are built up.

The command-line scripts have documentation included inside themselves. The visual scripts are all essentially the same, and are documented in [VISUALIZER].

Running the scripts
-------------------

You can always run a script using the Python command from an Anaconda terminal:

    python <path/to/script_name>.py

Or, if you are fine with using your default Python 3 installation of your system, you can run the script as follows:

    <path/to/script_name>.py

On Windows, replace ".py" by ".bat" or simply leave out the extension altogether: (".bat" is one of the default file extensions). If you don't want to always type out the complete path to the script, then you need to add the AI_track folder to your system's PATH.
