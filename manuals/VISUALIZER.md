The visualizer
==============

The visualizer is used in many scripts to visualize data.

The image viewer
----------------

The arrow keys allow you to switch to other photos. The left and right keys move backward and forward in time,
respectively. The up and down keys move up and down in the z-direction, respectively.

If you need to jump to a time point far away, it is best to use a command. Type `/f30` and then `ENTER`  to go to frame
number 30.

Press `T` to view the track of a single particle. You will end up in a separate view, where you can see the particle
trajectory 10 points forward or backwards in time. Double-click on any particle to focus on that particle instead.
Press `T` again to go back to the normal view.

Press `M` to jump to the mother view. Here you get an overview of all cell divisions found during the experiment. The
left and right arrow keys can now be used to jump to the next or previous cell division. Press `M` again to exit the
mother view and return to the normal view.
