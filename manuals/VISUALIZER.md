Navigating around
-----------------
The program consists of a menu bar, a title area, a figure area and a status/help area. The contents of all of these
depends on what you're doing. If you enter the cell detection view, then methods relevant to cell detection will be
shown. You can always go back to the main view using `View -> Exit this view`.

The program is highly keyboard-dependent, although there are also menu options available for everything. I prefer using
the keyboard shortcuts myself, but for people new to this program that is of course no options.

For most keyboard shortcuts, a menu option is available. For shortcuts where that wasn't possible (for example because
you need to place your mouse above a cell), an explanation text was added to the status/help area.

Many shortcuts consist of a single letter: if you press `E`. the errors and warnings screen is opened. For some other
shortcuts, you need to type a bit more: `/deaths` + `ENTER` for example opens up a list of all cell deaths.

The best way to get used to the program is to just try things. As long as you do not overwrite existing data, nothing
can go wrong.
